buggy_type: NoneError
key_code: None
reason: None.
result: None.
attack_method: None.
solution: None.

buggy_type: OverflowUnderflow
key_code: unit
reason: Storing a value in an integer variable bigger or smaller than its limits.
result: The resulting loss is immense and irreparable.
attack_method: Attackers can manipulate function parameters by passing values outside their defined limits.
solution: Verifying the arithmetic logic before and after execution. Using the Safe_Math library.

buggy_type: Reentrancy
key_code: call.value, msg.sender
reason: The fallback mechanism of smart contracts exposes external calls in their interface, which attackers can exploit to invoke functions multiple times.
result: Causing massive losses.
attack_method: Attackers can exploit the external call to re-enter the called function before the program execution ends.
solution: Using the built-in transfer() function when sending ether to external contracts. Ensuring that all logic that changes state variables happen before ether is sent out of the contract.

buggy_type: TimestampDependency
key_code: block.time_stamp
reason: The current timestamp of the block can be used by contracts to trigger some time-dependent events.
result: Miners change the timestamp to favor themselves.
attack_method: Malicious miners can change the timestamp to favor themselves.
solution: Block timestamps should not be the deciding factor for changing some important states.

buggy_type: UnhandledExceptions
key_code: send, call, call.value
reason: The contract is terminated, its state is reverted, and false is returned to the caller contract when an exception is thrown by the callee contact.
result: Leading to undesired behavior.
attack_method: Attackers can use unchecked returned values within the caller contract to attack the contract.
solution: Checking the return value of the send() instruction.
